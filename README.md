# SteamNoodles Feedback Agent System

## üìù Developer Information
- **Name:** Sahan Udayanga
- **University:** University of Moratuwa
- **Year:** 2025

## üçú Project Overview
This project consists of two intelligent agents for SteamNoodles restaurant chain:

1. **Feedback Analysis Agent:** Processes and responds to customer feedback with human-like, context-aware responses in multiple languages (English, Sinhala, Tamil).

2. **Sentiment Dashboard Agent:** Visualizes sentiment trends over time and generates analytical summaries of customer feedback.

The system leverages Google's Gemini model to analyze customer feedback, classify sentiment, determine urgency, identify emotions, and categorize feedback into business areas.

## üöÄ Approach Summary
My approach focused on creating a multi-functional feedback management system that:

- Uses LLM (Google's Gemini) for accurate sentiment analysis and multilingual response generation
- Provides real-time visualization of feedback trends
- Offers detailed category filtering and analysis
- Generates comprehensive summary reports for management
- Supports multilingual feedback handling (English, Sinhala, Tamil)

The architecture uses Flask for the backend API services and Streamlit for the interactive frontend dashboard.

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/SahanUday/steamnoodles-feedback-agent-Sahan_Udayanga.git
   cd steamnoodles-feedback-agent-Sahan_Udayanga
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv env
   # On Windows
   .\env\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source env/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Google API key:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   ```

## üß™ Testing the Agents

### Starting the Application
1. Start the Flask backend:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. In a new terminal, start the Streamlit frontend:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. Access the application in your browser at: http://localhost:8501

### Testing the Feedback Agent
1. Navigate to the "üì® Feedback Agent" page using the sidebar
2. Enter customer feedback in the text area
3. Click "Submit"
4. View the analyzed sentiment, urgency, emotion, category, and AI-generated response

#### Sample Prompts and Expected Outputs:
