# SteamNoodles Feedback Agent System
An AI-powered customer feedback analysis system for SteamNoodles restaurant chain that provides real-time sentiment analysis, automated response generation, and comprehensive dashboard analytics.

## üìù Developer Information
- **Name:** Sahan Udayanga
- **University:** University of Moratuwa
- **Year:** 3rd year

## üçú Project Overview
This project consists of two intelligent agents for SteamNoodles restaurant chain:

1. **Feedback Analysis Agent:**
   - Processes and responds to customer feedback with human-like, context-aware responses in multiple languages (English, Sinhala, Singlish, Tamil)
   - Multi-language Support: Analyzes feedback in English, Sinhala, and Tamil
   - Intelligent Analysis: Provides sentiment, urgency level, emotion detection, and business category classification
   - Automated Responses: Generates human-like, contextually appropriate replies in the same language as the feedback
   - Real-time Processing: Instant feedback analysis and response generation

2. **Sentiment Dashboard Agent:**
   - Visualizes sentiment trends over time and generates analytical summaries of customer feedback
   - Interactive Visualizations: Trend plots and pie charts for sentiment distribution
   - Flexible Time Ranges: Last 7 days, 30 days, or custom date ranges
   - Category Filtering: Filter feedback by business categories (Food Quality, Pricing, Cleanliness, Delivery, Other)
   - AI-Generated Summary Reports: Comprehensive sentiment analysis reports with insights

The system leverages Google's Gemini model to analyze customer feedback, classify sentiment, determine urgency, identify emotions, and categorize feedback into business areas.

## üöÄ Approach Summary
My approach focused on creating a multi-functional feedback management system that:

- Uses LLM (Google's Gemini) for accurate sentiment analysis and multilingual response generation
- Provides real-time visualization of feedback trends
- Offers detailed category filtering and analysis
- Generates comprehensive summary reports for management
- Supports multilingual feedback handling (English, Sinhala, Tamil)

The architecture uses Flask for the backend API services and Streamlit for the interactive frontend dashboard.

## üìä Features and Demo Output

### Feedback Analysis Agent
![Sample Feedback 1](./assets/sample_feedback_1.jpg)

The Feedback Analysis Agent is a sophisticated AI-powered tool that:
- Analyzes customer feedback in multiple languages (English, Sinhala, Tamil)
- Determines sentiment classification (Very Positive to Very Negative)
- Assesses urgency level (Low, Medium, High)
- Identifies dominant customer emotions
- Categorizes feedback by business area
- Generates human-like, contextually appropriate responses in the same language as the original feedback

**Process Flow:**
1. Customer submits feedback through the interface
2. Gemini AI model processes the input text
3. Analysis results are displayed (sentiment, urgency, emotion, category)
4. An appropriate response is automatically generated
5. Results are saved to the CSV database for future analysis

**Multilingual Capabilities:**
The agent handles various languages and writing styles:
- English text is processed and responded to in English
- Sinhala text (‡∂Ü‡∑Ñ‡∑è‡∂ª‡∂∫ ‡∑É‡∑î‡∂¥‡∑í‡∂ª‡∑í‡∂∫‡∑í!) receives Sinhala responses
- Tamil text (‡Æâ‡Æ£‡Æµ‡ØÅ ‡ÆÖ‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡ÆÆ‡Øà!) receives Tamil responses
- Transliterated text (Singlish/Tanglish) is properly interpreted

**Sample Outputs:**

**English Feedback:**
```
The food was excellent but the waiting time was too long. I had to wait for 30 minutes for my order.
```
![Sample Feedback 1](./assets/sample_feedback_1.jpg)

The analysis correctly identifies:
- Sentiment: Neutral (balancing positive food experience with negative waiting time)
- Urgency: Medium (indicates attention needed but not critical)
- Emotion: Frustration (captures the customer's emotional state)
- Category: Waiting Time (correctly categorizes the primary concern)

The response acknowledges both the positive food experience and addresses the waiting time concern with an apologetic tone and assurance of improvement.

**Sinhala Feedback:**
```
‡∂Ü‡∑Ñ‡∑è‡∂ª‡∂∫ ‡∑É‡∑î‡∂¥‡∑í‡∂ª‡∑í‡∂∫‡∑í! ‡∂Ö‡∂≠‡∑í‡∑Å‡∂∫‡∑í‡∂±‡∑ä ‡∑É‡∂≠‡∑î‡∂ß‡∑î‡∂∫‡∑í!
```
![Sample Feedback 2](./assets/sample_feedback_2.jpg)

For Sinhala feedback, the system accurately:
- Identifies the language
- Analyzes sentiment as Very Positive
- Assigns Low urgency (no action needed)
- Detects Joy as the primary emotion
- Categorizes as Food Quality
- Responds in fluent Sinhala with culturally appropriate phrasing

### Testing the Sentiment Dashboard

The Sentiment Dashboard Agent provides comprehensive visualization and analysis tools:

1. Navigate to the "üìä Sentiment Dashboard" page using the sidebar
2. Select a time range (Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, or Custom Range)
3. View the sentiment trend visualization
4. Switch between trend plots and pie charts
5. Filter by feedback category to see specific feedback examples
6. Generate AI-powered summary reports

## üìä Visualizing Dashboard

### Time Period Selection
![Time Range Selection](./assets/time_range_selecting.jpg)

The dashboard allows users to select different time ranges for analysis:
- Last 7 Days: Shows the most recent week of feedback
- Last 30 Days: Displays a monthly trend
- Custom Range: Enables selection of specific start and end dates for detailed analysis

This flexible time selection helps managers track sentiment changes over different periods and identify patterns or anomalies.

### Data Visualization

**Sentiment Trend Visualization**
![Trend Chart](./assets/trend_chart.jpg)

The line chart shows how different sentiment categories (Very Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, Very Negative) change over time. This visualization helps identify:
- Overall sentiment trends
- Specific days with unusual feedback patterns
- The effectiveness of new initiatives or changes in service

**Sentiment Distribution Pie Chart**
![Pie Chart](./assets/pie_chart.jpg)

The pie chart provides an at-a-glance view of the overall sentiment distribution within the selected time period. It shows the proportion of each sentiment category, making it easy to understand the general customer satisfaction level.

### Feedback Category Selection
![Feedback Categories](./assets/feedback_category.jpg)

Users can filter feedback by business categories:
- Food Quality
- Pricing
- Cleanliness
- Delivery
- Other

This feature allows management to focus on specific aspects of the business that may need attention. When a category is selected, the system displays example feedback from that category based on the data in the CSV file.

### Summary Report Generation
![Report Summary](./assets/report_summary.jpg)

The system can generate comprehensive summaries of customer sentiment for any selected time period, highlighting key trends, successes, and areas for improvement.
